    "Exercise 2 consists of 3 problems that you can find in this notebook. For each problem you need to modify the notebook either by fixing problems in existing code, or by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).  \n",
